== 2.0.6 2009-08-01

* Fixed a couple of bugs:
  - Chris Gibson: When forcing the repository type, Piston would break because
                  it called #downcase on a Symbol. 1bcc16bf8 
  - Terry Heath:  Subversion's --non-interactive would prevent OS X's keychain
                  from kicking in. 93d9a957
  - Florian Aßmann: In certain cases, the revision would be a String, and
                    other times it would be an Integer.  Normalize before
                    comparing. 40c0bc4e
