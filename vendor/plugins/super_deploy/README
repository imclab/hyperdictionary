SuperDeploy is a collection of Capistrano recipes; some simple, some not. They just make development easier.

Many of the tasks in it are cobbled together from a number of other sources. I'd credit them, if I hadn't long since forgotten who wrote 'em. If it's you, just email me and I'll do so.

Some - particularly the util:logs:smart, :short, :google, and :google_subtotals - are mine, and released under Creative Commons by-nc-sa license and MIT license (take your pick).

util:logs:smart is one I use most routinely. It essentially gives you a live aggregated view of  your hits, errors, and load times (by scraping logs), all in a nice little table. 

Try it out and enjoy.


TO INSTALL:

script/plugin install git://github.com/saizai/superdeploy.git
cap -T # See all you can do
cap util:logs:smart # use the fancy live hits/errors/loadtimes watcher


IF YOU HAVE OTHER TRICKS:
Send me a pull request and I'll merge 'em in!

I'd like this to be a nice one-stop library of cool toys that make a Capistrano user's life easier.


KNOWN BUGS:
* the hits/min exponential moving average has something wrong with it. Never got around to fixing.
* util:logs:smart is not routing-savvy. If you use something other than simple URLs, it's likely to get confused.
* all util:logs methods miss some hits. This is because underlyingly, Capistrano breaks stuff up 
arbitrarily (by size), rather than by paragraph of log. This could be fixed by writing a wrapper
that acts as a buffer and stitches the log back together again. I never found it worth the bother.
If you do, please feel free to commit a fix.
