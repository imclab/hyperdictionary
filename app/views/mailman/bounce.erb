Hi! 

You just tried to use <%= APP_NAME %>'s automatic email interface.

However, you either aren't a <%= APP_NAME %> user, or you haven't registered <%= h @email %> as one of your contacts.

To do so, log in at <%= h @url %>, click 'preferences', then click the plus next to contacts.

If you were trying to reach a human, please contact <%= ADMIN_EMAIL %>; this address is only monitored by the <%= APP_NAME %> email bot.

Thanks!

- <%= APP_NAME %> email bot
